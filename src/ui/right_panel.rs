// steps are close together on purpose: the panel is a dense aside next to the
// terminal, and the differences between them are meant to be felt as hierarchy
// rather than seen as different type sizes.
//
// Every tab of the panel is on this ladder now. The px constants that used to
// live here — PANEL_TEXT and its steps — went when the interface font scale
// landed, and `scm/` followed a branch later: it had been cut from main hours
// before that commit and had copied the ladder as it stood, which left the
// Source Control tab frozen at the *old* 12/11/10.5 while its neighbours moved
// to 14/13/12/11 and started tracking `ui_font_size`. Nothing in git conflicted
// — the two touched different files — so the only thing that would have caught
// it was a reader noticing that one tab was a step smaller than the rest.

// Which is the reason to keep reaching for these names rather than spelling a
// number: a size written as `px(12.)` anywhere in this panel is either a
// mistake or something that is not type.

/// outside the row and the row adds it back inside — so all this number sets
/// is how far the hover fill bleeds past the text. It lives here rather than
/// in one tab because every tab of this panel is the same list of rows seen
/// from a different angle, and a fill that bleeds 4px under Source Control and
/// 6px under Info is a panel whose rows visibly do not belong to each other.

/// of it, or the list crawls under the pointer.
///
/// It stops the mouse-down by hand instead of calling `occlude()`, which is
/// the obvious way to keep a click off the row underneath and was what made
/// the buttons vanish the moment the pointer reached them. `occlude()` is a
/// *hitbox* behaviour, and gpui inserts hitboxes in prepaint, which never
/// looks at `visibility` — so the strip blocked the mouse even while it was
/// invisible. Blocking cuts the hit test short at the blocking hitbox, and the
/// row's hitbox is behind this one because a parent prepaints before its
/// children; `group_hover` is nothing more than "is the group's hitbox
/// hovered", so the row stopped counting as hovered and the strip hid itself
/// — background, buttons and all — with the pointer sitting right on it. The
/// buttons' own hitboxes came from prepaint and outlived the paint, so they
/// went on answering tooltips for glyphs that were no longer drawn.
///
/// Stopping propagation buys the same "this click is ours, not the row's"
/// without lying to the hit test: children register their handlers after this
