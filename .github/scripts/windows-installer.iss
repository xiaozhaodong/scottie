; tty7 Windows installer (Inno Setup 6 — preinstalled on GitHub's
; windows-latest runners). Compiled by bundle-windows.ps1, which stages the
; payload and passes every path in via /D defines:
;
;   /DAppVersion=<semver>   display version parsed from Cargo.toml
;   /DVersionInfoVersion=<numeric version> PE-compatible file version
;   /DStageDir=<abs path>   staged payload (app, CLI, updater, marker, resources)
;   /DOutputDir=<abs path>  where the setup exe is written
;   /DOutputName=<basename> setup exe filename, without ".exe"
;
; Defaults to a per-user install ({localappdata}\Programs\tty7 — no UAC
; prompt), with an "install for all users" escape hatch in the dialog. The
; build is unsigned, so SmartScreen warns on first launch either way — same as
; the portable zip.

; Builds before the tty7/tty7-app split installed the GUI as tty7.exe. Upgrading
; only *adds* tty7-app.exe, so the old binary would stay on disk — and a taskbar
; pin (which Inno cannot rewrite, unlike the [Icons] shortcuts) still points at
; it. The user would keep launching the previous version from their pinned icon,
; against the same daemon endpoint as the new one. Delete it on upgrade; a fresh
; install simply has nothing to remove.
;
; That name is now reused by the CLI below, which lands at the very same path.
; The order saves us: [InstallDelete] runs before [Files], so the stale GUI is
; gone before the CLI is written, and what survives is never a mix of the two.
; The taskbar pin is the loose end — post-upgrade it points at a CLI, so
; clicking it flashes a console instead of opening a window. That is louder
; than the bug it replaces (silently running last release's GUI), and the pin
; is not ours to rewrite; the Start Menu entry in [Icons] is correct either way.

; AppUserModelID is what lets toast notifications carry the tty7 name and icon

; `core::aumid::AUMID` (src/core/aumid.rs), which at startup stamps the
; per-user shortcut below if some older installer left it unstamped, and
; writes one from scratch for the portable zip. It deliberately leaves an
; all-users install alone — it cannot write {commonprograms} unelevated, and a
; per-user twin would both duplicate the Start Menu entry and outlive this
; uninstaller — so an elevated install depends on the stamp right here.

[UninstallRun]
; Stop the daemon before the uninstaller deletes tty7-app.exe — the running daemon
; is the locked image of that file, so removing it fails otherwise. Naming {app}
; widens the stop the same way PrepareToInstall's does: ConPTY hosts orphaned by
; a daemon that never got to shut down keep the installed images open, and their
; DeleteFile fails an uninstall exactly as it fails an upgrade. (The stop excludes
; the calling process itself, so the binary running this step is safe.) This runs
; at the start of uninstallation, before any files are removed. The installed
; binary is this version, which understands the flags; runhidden suppresses any
; flash and the call returns without opening a window. RunOnceId keys the entry
; so a repeated uninstall doesn't run it twice.
Filename: "{app}\tty7-app.exe"; Parameters: "--stop-daemon --update-install-dir ""{app}"""; Flags: runhidden waituntilterminated; RunOnceId: "StopDaemon"
; Unconditional, and deliberately not gated on the task: an install that had the
; menu registered and was later upgraded without the box ticked still holds the
; keys, and verbs pointing at a deleted exe are worse than a no-op. Removing keys
; that were never written succeeds silently.

[Code]
(* Gracefully stop the persistent daemon before we overwrite tty7-app.exe. We can't
  run the *installed* binary here — on an upgrade from an older build it may not
  understand --stop-daemon and would launch the GUI instead — so we extract the
  *new* tty7-app.exe to {tmp} and run that. It connects to the running daemon, hangs
  up every shell, waits for it to exit (releasing the file lock), then returns
  without opening a window. Naming {app} widens the stop into "make this directory
  replaceable": ConPTY hosts (OpenConsole.exe) orphaned by a daemon that never got
  to shut down keep the installed images open — invisible to the daemon stop, fatal
  to the DeleteFile below — so anything still running from {app} is terminated and
  the call waits until the images there actually open for writing. Best effort: any
  failure falls through to the Restart Manager backstop, and a fresh install simply
  has nothing to stop. *)

  ResultCode: Integer;

(* Take {app} back out of the user's PATH.

  `core::cli_install` puts it there at first launch rather than the installer
  doing it, because the portable zip has no installer — but that leaves nobody
  to undo it, and an uninstall that permanently grows the user's PATH by one
  dead entry is not an uninstall. So the removal lives here, on the one install
  shape that has an uninstaller at all. (Unix has no equivalent hook: deleting
  the .app or the tarball leaves the symlink behind for the user to remove.)

  HKCU even for an all-users install: cli_install only ever writes the user
  hive, so that is the only place an entry can be. On a machine where several
  users ran tty7, this clears the one uninstalling — the others keep a dead
  entry, which is the price of not needing elevation to install in the first
  place.

  Entries are compared case-insensitively and ignoring a trailing backslash,
  and every other entry is written back verbatim: this is somebody's PATH, and
  we are here to remove one thing from it, not to tidy it. No
  WM_SETTINGCHANGE broadcast — the entry now names a deleted directory, so
  nothing is waiting on the news, and it is gone from new shells at next
  sign-in regardless. *)

(* Remove the optional Explorer verbs if this user enabled them in Settings.

  The application owns only the final `tty7` subkeys. Deleting those trees
  removes their command children without touching another application's verb
  or a shared `shell` parent. Missing keys are the normal default and make both
  calls harmless no-ops. This cleanup is uninstall-only: upgrades keep the
  user's explicit registration, and the next app launch reports "Needs update"
  if an install path ever changes. *)
